C++ implementations of algorithms introduced in "6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning" (http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.036/spring_2014/info.html)

Perceptron
----------

This implementation of perceptron uses classifier that passes through the origin. To introduce an additional constant, augment the input vector with an extra '1'.
i.e. instead of (x_1 , ... , x_n), use (1 , x_1 ... , x_n)
